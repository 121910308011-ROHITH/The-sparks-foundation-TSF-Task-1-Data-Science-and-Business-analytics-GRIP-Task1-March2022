Predicting Scores Based on Study Hours
Task 1: The Sparks Foundation GRIP (March 2022)

This project predicts students' scores based on the number of hours they study using a Simple Linear Regression Model.

Objective
To predict students' scores using their study hours with a supervised learning model.

Methodology
Linear Regression is used to model the relationship between study hours and scores.
The model is trained using historical data and evaluates performance with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (R²).
Key Steps
Data Exploration: Visualizing the correlation between study hours and scores.
Model Training: Fitting a linear regression model to predict scores.
Prediction: Predicting the score for a given study time (e.g., 9.25 hours).
Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
This project helps demonstrate the application of Supervised Machine Learning to make predictions based on simple data.
