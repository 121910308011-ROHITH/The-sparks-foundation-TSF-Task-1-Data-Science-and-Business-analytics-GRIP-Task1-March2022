# Predicting Scores Based on Study Hours  
**Task 1: The Sparks Foundation GRIP (March 2022)**

This project predicts students' scores based on the number of hours they study using a **Simple Linear Regression Model**.

## **Objective**  
To predict students' scores using their study hours with a supervised learning model.

## **Methodology**  
- **Linear Regression** is used to model the relationship between study hours and scores.
- The model is trained using historical data and evaluates performance with **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **R-squared (RÂ²)**.

## **Key Steps**  
1. **Data Exploration**: Visualizing the correlation between study hours and scores.
2. **Model Training**: Fitting a linear regression model to predict scores.
3. **Prediction**: Predicting the score for a given study time (e.g., 9.25 hours).

## **Technologies Used**  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)

This project helps demonstrate the application of **Supervised Machine Learning** to make predictions based on simple data.
